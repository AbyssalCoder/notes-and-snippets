Practiced Docker Containers with some exercises.

The hands-on practice made the theory click.

## Fibonacci Sequence

### Iterative approach

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i), end=' ')
# 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```

**Key takeaway:** The iterative version runs in O(n) time and O(1) space.

Morning study session: Lovable.

Going to revisit this topic next week for deeper understanding.

## Exception Handling

```python
def safe_divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print('Cannot divide by zero!')
        return None
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f'Type error: {e}')
        return None
    finally:
        print('Division attempted.')

print(safe_divide(10, 3))
print(safe_divide(10, 0))
```

`finally` always runs — useful for cleanup.

Explored Array Traversal — here are my notes.

Understanding the 'why' behind this made everything clearer.
